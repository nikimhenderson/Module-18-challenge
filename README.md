# Tableau-NewYork-CitiBikeData
A tableau storyboard was created using the [CitiBike data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) from <br/>
March, April and May 2024 in Jersey City (JC).<br/>

Attached here for your review is my original preprocessing jupyter notebook where I cleaned the data before importing it into Tableau.<br/>

## Introduction
The goal of this project was to perform exploratory analyses on the Citi Bike data, which includes data on:
   * Ride ID
   * Rideable type (electric or classic)
   * Started at (time)
   * Ended at (time)
   * Start station name
   * Start station ID
   * End station name
   * End station ID
   * Start latitude
   * Start longitude
   * End latitude
   * End Longitude
   * Member or casual rider

The data used was from Jersey City (JC) from March, April and May 2024, downloadable at [https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html) 
   * JC-202403-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
   * JC-202404-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
   * JC-202405-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip

### Instructions
1. Clean your data
2. Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon
3. Use your visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomenon
4. Create a dynamic map
5. Create a tableau story that brings together the visualizations, maps and dashboards
6. Deploy on Tableau Public

## Questions
While there were many questions I could have answered with this data I chose to focus on the difference between member and casual riders.
1. Do casual or member riders frequent certain starting and ending locations?
2. When is the most ideal time to perform maintenance on bikes for members vs casual riders?

## How to use
Attached here for your review is my original preprocessing jupyter notebook where I cleaned the data before importing it into Tableau.
The original csv files are also provided in the Resources folder <br/>
